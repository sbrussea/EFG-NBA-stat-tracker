# EFG-NBA-stat-tracker (Fantasy Basketball)
A quick script that allows you to manipulate stats so that you can get any combination of stats and manipulation of stats you want from any year in NBA history


To start you have to install Beautiful Soup 4 (BS4) and requests. 

To select stats that you want to see, or to manipulate into another stat, go into the .txt file to see what stat lines up with which index in the table we get the stats from. Example: [1] is a player position or [0] is their name.

The output will automatically be created in .txt files in the folder you have the program in. If you want to see a quick version, add a print statement saying print(result) at the end of the function EFGFinder.

To install BS4/ requests: 
type this into your python console. Then just copy paste the output to terminal/ command prompt


import sys
print(f'sudo "{sys.executable}" -m pip install ____’)
print(f'sudo "{sys.executable}" -m pip install ____’)
